This repository has the code and documents of my Google data Analytics case study for the capstone project

The Project is an exploration of an Open to public dataset on the Top 50 Bestselling Books in Amazon.
The dataset was analysed and the insights were visualized.

The SQL code as well as Visualization are also shared.

Have a look at the document given below which details the steps and processes followed.
